# Hi
My name is Hampus, but online I refer myself to Seffra.
I have been programming as a hobby sometime since 2012 and initially I started building games, but today I work on systems mostly related to networking. 

I am also currently studying for a computer engineering bachelor degree in Sweden. 

My current favourite editor is Neovim, but I have used VS Code professionally so I occasionally relapse. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working
  - on finding time to work on personal projects
  - as a software developer at a telecom firm
  - as a teacher's assistant at my university
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - golang
  - embedded systems
  - cyber security
  - feedback control engineering
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
  - some telecom, specifically asterisk related
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about old telephones
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - email: hampus.avekvist@hey.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: old phones send signals, and you can interpret those signals however you prefer
