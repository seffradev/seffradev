# Hi, I'm Hampus

Though, you may refer to me as `seffradev` online. I'm a (he/him)
type of guy.

## Short about me
- **I have been programming** in my spare time since 2012,
  professionally since 2021.
- **I have an almost complete** Bachelor's degree in computer
  engineering from University West.
- **I spend my time tinkering** with NixOS and Neovim.
- **I've delved deep into C++** to improve both my own code, but
  also the code at my job.
- **I care deeply about** quality, readability, and helping my
  peers improve.

## My current obsession
- **My own GameBoy emulator**,
  [`gbpp`](https://github.com/seffradev/gbpp), which aims to be a
  runtime-agnostic emulator.
- **And the heaps of C++ and software engineering books** that I've
  read or is currently reading. Check out [my
  Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/seffradev) for an actively
  updated list and reviews.

## Some projects I occasionally maintain
- [asterisk-rs](https://github.com/seffradev/asterisk-rs) which is
  a set of Rust crates for interfacing with Asterisk, a free and
  open source PBX.
- The Rust crate that provides an API interface to
  [thecocktaildb](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/), cleverly called
  [thecocktaildb-rs](https://github.com/seffradev/thecocktaildb-rs).
