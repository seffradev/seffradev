# Hi
My name is Hampus, but online I refer myself to Seffra.
I have been programming as a hobby sometime since 2012 and initially I started
building games, but today I work on systems mostly related to networking.

I am also currently studying my last year of a computer engineering bachelor
degree in Sweden.

My current favourite editor is Neovim, but I have used VS Code professionally
so I occasionally relapse.

## My projects
- [asterisk-rs](https://github.com/seffradev/asterisk-rs)
- [thecocktaildb-rs](https://github.com/seffradev/thecocktaildb-rs)

And I also maintain a sensible (to me)
[Rust project template](https://github.com/seffradev/rust-template) using
`cargo-generate`.

## But what do I do?
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working
  - on finding time to work on personal projects
  - as a software developer at a telecom firm
  - as a teacher's assistant at my university
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
  - rust
  - feedback control engineering
  - software engineering (university course)
  - advanced topics in computer engineering (very vague, am I right, also a course)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
  - some telecom, specifically asterisk related
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about old telephones
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
  - email: hampus.avekvist@hey.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've figured out a way to build a Whac-a-mole game with analogue phones
